      Lab Maniac lets a planeswalker practice their craft.
      You can edit the format by editing the first component of the URL (the bit after labmaniac.com, that looks something like "6KTK").
      If you mess up a pack name or don't provide six packs, then you'll get an error message rather than an invalid pool.

      Caveats:
        * Sets with weird slots such as a guaranteed basic lands cycle, double-faced cards, or crazy nonsense (such as Return to Ravnica, Innistrad, or Timespiral) generate packs that don't match the real ones.
        * The chance of a rare collision is higher because print runs aren't emulated.
        * Also, print runs aren't emulated.
        * No extra-rare common (a.k.a the 101st common).
