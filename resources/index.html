        Lab Maniac lets planeswalkers practice their craft. Specifically, building sealed pools.
      </p>

      <p>
      Move cards by clicking on them and dragging with your mouse.
      You can also move multiple cards by selecting them first.
      To select cards, click and drag on the background between the cards and then highlight the cards you want selected.
      Once cards have been selected, click on them and drag to move all the selected cards to a new place.
      </p>

      <p>
      Use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to undo and redo the card movements you've made.
      You can also use the "u" and "r" keys on your keyboard as shortcuts for undo &amp; redo.
      </p>

      <p>
      The "New Pool" button will generate a new pool in the same format as the current pool.
      You can change the format by changing the path of the URL in your browser's address bar. The path is the part after "http://labmaniac.com/", that is right now probably "6KTK" followed by a slash and a bunch of numbers.
      For example, to switch to the Lorwyn block sealed format, change the part of the URL that starts with "6KTK" to "3LRW3MOR", making the final URL "http://labmaniac.com/3LRW3MOR".
      If you mess up a set's code or don't provide six packs, then you'll get an error message rather than an illegal pool.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each pool is uniquely identified by the numbers at the end of the URL.
      If you go back to the same URL, you'll see the same pool.
      If you send the full URL to someone else, they'll see the same cards that you do.
      </p>

      <p>
      The way that you've layed out your pool will be saved in your browser.
      This means that if you lay out a deck in a pool, you can go back to the pool later and the deck will still be there.
      But, since the piles are just saved in your browser, if you use a different browser, or send the link to somebody else, they'll only see the default starting layout.
      There is limited space available to save the piles; once you get to around 100 saved pools, the oldest pools will be deleted to free up space for the new ones.
