        Lab Maniac lets planeswalkers practice their craft.

      Click and drag with your mouse to select cards.
      Once cards are selected, you can click and drag on any selected pile to move all the selected cards to a new place.
      You can use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to move back and forward through your card movements.
      You can also use the "u" and "r" keys on your keyboard as shortcuts for undo &amp; redo.

      <p>
      The "New Pool" button will generate a new pool with the same set of packs as the current pool.
      You can change the format by changing the path of the URL (the bit after "http://labmaniac.com/", that looks something like "6KTK" followed by a slash and a bunch of numbers).
      For example, to switch to the Lorwyn block sealed format, change the "6KTK" part in the URL to "3LRW3MOR", making the final URL "http://labmaniac.com/3LRW3MOR".
      If you mess up a pack name or don't provide six packs, then you'll get an error message rather than an invalid pool.
      </p>

      <p>
      The piles you've made will be saved in your browser.
      This means that if you lay out a deck in a particular pool, you can go back to it later and see it (each URL corresponds to a unique pool).
      Since it's just saved in your browser, if you use a different browser, or send the link to somebody else, they'll see the default starting layout.
      There is limited space available to save the piles; once you get to around 100 saved pools, the oldest pools will be deleted to free up space for the new ones.
